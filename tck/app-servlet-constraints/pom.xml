	<description>
        This module contain tests that do HTTP requests to several resources which are protected in different ways via constraints
        in a Servlet web.xml.
        
        The tests do no check anything specific to Jakarta Authorization, and as such the tests should also pass on
        a Servlet container that does not use Jakarta Authorization at all, as the same behaviour is also specified 
        by Servlet.
        
        It is the responsibility of the compatible implementation that is being tested here to make sure that
        Jakarta Authorization is indeed used, so that these tests indeed test the Jakarta Authorization implementation.
